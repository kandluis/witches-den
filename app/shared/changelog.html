        <h2>Change Log</h2>

        <h4>v1.1.1</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug causing a category to not display in the faction graph if the first faction in that category didn't score points for that category</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>v1.1.0</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the faction score graph to be horizontal.</li>

            <li>Game name appears in search box when hardlinking to a page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>v1.0.4</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reworked handling for leeching to better handle Cultists and Shapeshifters. (They can get +CULT or Gain P3 Token on the same line as the leech, which was messing stuff up)</li>

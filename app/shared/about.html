        <h2>The Basics</h2>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p> Witches' Den is a game analyzer for Juho Snellman's Online Terra Mystica 
            implementation (terra.snellman.net). As I begun playing more, I was 
            constantly looking for how to improve, and this site is my attempt to 
            build the tools and perform the research to answer that question. 
            Specficially, I was looking to answer questions like: 
            <ul>
                <li>How many points am I spending to leech power?</li>
                <li>How many points does fav11 really get me?</li>
                <li>Am I using the pass bonus tiles well for points?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p> My name is ryan echternacht (user: ryan.echternacht), and I just started
            playing Terra Mystica (both online and in person). I think it's a 
            phenomenal game, and I'm glad to see such a strong community built 
            around it. I made this site to improve my play and give back. If you
            want to know more, have feedback, find a bug, or get involved, hit me 
            up at ryan [at] echternacht [dot] org. 

        <h4>My Goals</h4>
        <p>
            When I started building the site, I didn't know that Juho provided some
            of this information already -- now I do (you can find it if you click
            on your score ingame). Regardless, I envision taking this much 
            farther. Some of the questions I'd like to answer:
            <ul>
                <li>On average, how many points do people gain from the Engineer's 
                    Stronghold</li>
                <li>How many towns do most people found with X faction</li>
                <li>Based on this board setup, which faction should I select?</li>
                <li>Based on this board setup, and faction X, how many points should
                    I get? Did I meet the goal? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>How built up should I be by the end of round 3?</li>
                <li>When I'm halflings, how many digs should I shoot for with a
                    Round 4 spade scoring tile</li>
            </ul>
            Overall, I'm focused on learning from other plays to improve my play. 
            One of my overall goals is to compare my scores against my "peers" 
            (e.g. players +/-100 rating) and against the "best" players (e.g. top 
            10%) to see where I'm underscoring. 
        </p>

        <h4>Focus on Points</h4>
        <p>
            As an overall guideline, my analysis is focused on scoring points, not
            winning. While the two items are intrisically linked, I think focusing
            on improving my score is a better guideline than focusing on beating
            others -- both because it's easier to measure in isolation and because
            I think it should be more stable over time. Perhaps these are faulty
            assumptions, but I plan to keep them for now.
        </p>

        <h4>How it Works (in short)</h4>
        <p>
            The specific data I gather is the data found in Snellman's ingame log.
            Specifically, I'm parsing those logs to determine what scoring sources
            a player has (e.g. current round bonus, current pass tile bonus, favors)
            and then checking every action against these for scoring. I'm reconciling
            this with Snellman's calculation every action. If you see any points
            labeled as "unknown", these are times when I come to a differnet count
            than Snellman -- please tell me if you see these and I'll investigate
            why and fix it. If you care about the technical details, see the later
            sections.

        <h4>How You Can Help</h4>
        <p>
            The easiest way to help is to use the site :). The more you use it, the
            more I want to keep building. Besides that, feel free to email me (ryan
            [at] echternacht [dot] org) with ideas, improvements, bugs, or 
            requests. If you're technical, the site is on 
            <a href="https://github.com/ryanechternacht/witches-den/">GitHub</a>, 
            and more technicals details can be found there. I'm using a 
            <a href="https://trello.com/b/4P3kIOjo/witches-den">Trello Board</a> to
            track my progress and ideas. Check it out and let me know if you 
            think I should prioritize anything in particular.

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p> 
            The site is modeled on the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node), 
            hosted on Windows Azure, with a focus on PaaS (platform-as-a-service). 
            A largeimpetus for this project (to me) was to tryout a complete PaaS 
            environment -- I have nothing but great things to say so far. I also
            wanted to leverage DSLs (Domain Specific Languages), so I was happy to 
            include parsing Snellman's log as part of my work (I'm specifically 
            using PegJS). 
        </p>

        <p>
            The production version of the site is hosted at 
            witchesden.echternacht.org, built off of my master branch on GitHub. 
            There is also a development version hosted
            at dwitchesden.echternacht.org, which is built off of my develop branch.
            I try to keep the dev site stable, but I'm sure I'll break it from time 
            to time. 
        </p>

Parser is generated via the online generator found at pegjs.org/online. 

The grammer file terra_grammar.pegjs is entered there, and then a parser is 
downloaded and named terra_parser.js. After downloading the grammar, I change the first line from

"module.exports = function(...)" to "var parser = function(...)"

Another possible approach is to reference peg.js source and build my own, but 
since for now, I like developing the grammar interactively, I having the grammar
pre-compiled is fine.
